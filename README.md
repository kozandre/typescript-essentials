# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/51559115/achievements/vky8cx5m)
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/51559115/achievements/24xx2nqv)
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/51559115/achievements/n793bmxf)
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/51559115/achievements/9ns9sq4u)
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/51559115/achievements/cwsnpjh9)
6. **Generics in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/51559115/achievements/ejz5de6p)
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/51559115/achievements/hy64tcm8)
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/51559115/achievements/24y9q7av)

## Reflections

Thanks to these modules, I learned about the basics of TypeScript: how to declare typed variables, how to implement interfaces,  develop typed functions, how to declare classes and use them, understand how to use generics for creating reusable components, how to work with external libraries and organize code with namespaces
